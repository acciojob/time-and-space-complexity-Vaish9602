    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
      Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. 
      It helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time. 
      An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient because it performs faster as input size grows.

    <p>
      <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute completely. 
      It includes both the memory used by variables and the call stack. 
      For example, an algorithm that uses linear memory can be said to have a Space Complexity of O(n), 
      which indicates that the memory usage grows proportionally with the input size.
